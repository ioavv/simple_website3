        Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research.
        Within the Solar System, it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. 
        Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions,
        two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.
        Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 
        71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. 
        The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.

      <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
         "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
          The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.
          Although humans are part of nature,
          human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
